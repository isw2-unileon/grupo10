## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed before proceeding:

| Tool | Version | Download |
|---|---|---|
| Git | Any recent | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) |
| Docker Desktop | Latest | [docker.com/get-started](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) |
| Go | 1.23+ | [go.dev/dl](https://go.dev/dl/) *(only needed to run the server outside Docker)* |

> **Windows users:** Docker Desktop already includes Docker Compose. Make sure Docker Desktop is running before executing any `docker` command.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/isw2-unileon/grupo10.git
cd grupo10
```

### 2. Set up environment variables

**Linux / macOS**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Windows (Command Prompt)**
```cmd
copy .env.example .env
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

The `.env` file should contain:

```env
DB_USER=user
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_NAME=learning_platform
DB_PORT_HOST=5432
SERVER_PORT_HOST=8080
```

> The default values work out of the box for local development. Only change them if you have port conflicts.

### 3. Start the stack

```bash
docker compose up
```

This command works the same on Linux, macOS, and Windows. The server will automatically run the database migrations on startup.

Once running:
- Backend: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

Verify the backend is healthy:

**Linux / macOS / Windows (PowerShell 5+)**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
# → {"status":"ok"}
```

## Resetting the database

Useful during development if you need to wipe and recreate the schema:

```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose up
```

The `-v` flag removes the postgres volume, giving you a clean slate. Migrations will run again automatically on the next startup.
